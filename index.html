            <!--Project Statement-->
            <hr>
            <h2>Project Problem Statement</h2>
            With the introduction to music services such as Apple Music, Pandora, and Spotify, Music recommender systems
            (MRS) have exploded in popularity. A popular feature that many streaming services have is recommended new songs
            for users to listen to based on their listening history. Although music recommender systems are common, many
            systems differ in the way they recommend songs.
            <br><br>
            In particular, a problem that many recommender systems come across is the playlist generation problem--
            Recommending new songs a user should add to the playlist given a set of songs already in the playlist. Within
            this problem, there lies a "cold start" problem, where the recommender must recommend songs to a playlist with
            very few songs in it.
            <br><br>
            For this project, we are focusing on Spotify's playlists. Spotify is known for its curated playlists--ones
            created by their team of music artists and ones created by their recommender system along with suggestions for
            users to add to their already exisiting playlist. As Spotify users ourselves, we are excited to dive into
            this problem and see how well we can recommend songs.

            <!--Project Goal-->
            <hr>
            <h2>Project Goal</h2>
            Automatic Playlist Generation — create a model for song discovery on the basis of the base playlist and
            user/context information that might be important to quality of a playlist. Some of user/context information
            might include intent, emotion, location, playlist “purpose” (driving/road trip, studying, etc). Use the
            developed model(s) for automatic playlist generation.
            <br><br>

                    <h3>Million Playlist Dataset</h3>
                    The <b>Million Playlist Dataset</b> contains 1,000,000 playlists created by users on the Spotify platform.
                    These playlists were created during the period of January 2010 through October 2017. Each playlist in
                    the MPD contains a playlist title, the track list (including track metadata) editing information (last
                    edit time, number of playlist edits) and other miscellaneous information about the playlist.

                    <h4>Detailed Description</h4>
                    The Million Playlist Dataset consists of 1,000 slice files. These files have the naming convention of:
                    <ul>mpd.slice._STARTING_PLAYLIST_ID_-_ENDING_PLAYLIST_ID_.json</ul>
                    For example, the first 1,000 playlists in the MPD are in a file called  mpd.slice.0-999.json and the last
                    1,000 playlists are in a file called mpd.slice.999000-999999.json. Each slice file is a JSON dictionary with
                    two fields: info and playlists.
                </div>
                <div class="col-sm-4">
                    <img src="img/spotify.png" style="width:231px; height:300px;">
                </div>
            </div>
            <h4>info Field</h4>
                The info field is a dictionary that contains general information about the particular slice:
                <li>slice - the range of slices that in in this particular file - such as 0-999</li>
                <li>version - - the current version of the MPD (which should be v1)</li>
                <li>generated_on - a timestamp indicating when the slice was generated.</li>

            <h4>playlists Field</h4>
                This is an array that typically contains 1,000 playlists. Each playlist is a dictionary that contains
                the following fields:
                <li>pid - integer - playlist id - the MPD ID of this playlist. This is an integer between 0 and
                    999,999.</li>
                <li>name - string - the name of the playlist</li>
                <li> description - optional string - if present, the description given to the playlist. Note that userprovided
                playlist descrptions are a relatively new feature of Spotify, so most playlists do not
                    have descriptions. </li>
                <li>modified_at - seconds - timestamp (in seconds since the epoch) when this playlist was last
                    updated. Times are rounded to midnight GMT of the date when the playlist was last updated.</li>
                <li>num_artists - the total number of unique artists for the tracks in the playlist.</li>
                <li>num_albums - the number of unique albums for the tracks in the playlist</li>
                <li>num_tracks - the number of tracks in the playlist</li>
                <li>num_followers - the number of followers this playlist had at the time the MPD was created.
                    (Note that the follower count does not including the playlist creator)</li>
                <li>num_edits - the number of separate editing sessions. Tracks added in a two hour window
                    are considered to be added in a single editing session.</li>
                <li>duration_ms - the total duration of all the tracks in the playlist (in milliseconds)</li>
                <li>collaborative - boolean - if true, the playlist is a collaborative playlist. Multiple users may
                    contribute tracks to a collaborative playlist.</li>
                <li>tracks - an array of information about each track in the playlist. Each element in the array is
                    a dictionary with the following fields:</li>
                <li>track_name - the name of the track</li>
                <li>track_uri - the Spotify URI of the track</li>
                <li>album_name - the name of the track’s album</li>
                <li>album_uri - the Spotify URI of the album</li>
                <li>artist_name - the name of the track’s primary artist</li>
                <li>artist_uri - the Spotify URI of track’s primary artist</li>
                <li>duration_ms - the duration of the track in milliseconds</li>
                <li>pos - the position of the track in the playlist (zero-based)</li>
