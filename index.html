                <!--Project Statement-->
                <hr>
                <h2>Project Problem Statement</h2>
                With the introduction to music services such as Apple Music, Pandora, and Spotify, Music recommender systems
                (MRS) have exploded in popularity. A popular feature that many streaming services have is recommended new songs
                for users to listen to based on their listening history. Although music recommender systems are common, many
                systems differ in the way they recommend songs.
                <br><br>
                In particular, a problem that many recommender systems come across is the playlist generation problem--
                Recommending new songs a user should add to the playlist given a set of songs already in the playlist. Within
                this problem, there lies a "cold start" problem, where the recommender must recommend songs to a playlist with
                very few songs in it.
                <br><br>
                For this project, we are focusing on Spotify's playlists. Spotify is known for its curated playlists--ones
                created by their team of music artists and ones created by their recommender system along with suggestions for
                users to add to their already exisiting playlist. As Spotify users ourselves, we are excited to dive into
                this problem and see how well we can recommend songs.

                <!--Project Goal-->
                <hr>
                <h2>Project Goal</h2>
                Automatic Playlist Generation — create a model for song discovery on the basis of the base playlist and
                user/context information that might be important to quality of a playlist. Some of user/context information
                might include intent, emotion, location, playlist “purpose” (driving/road trip, studying, etc). Use the
                developed model(s) for automatic playlist generation.
                <br><br>

                <!--Motivation-->
                <hr>
                <h2>Motivation</h2>
                As avid music listeners, from trap music to hard core Taylor Swift, with cravings for new tracks to listen to,
                we knew we wanted to create a Music Recommender System (MRS). While creating our algorithm, we kept in mind
                what we would want our MRS to recommend to our own Spotify playlists. Recommending songs is never easy, but
                we were up for the challenge and are excited to use to tools we've learned in Data Science to see how accurate
                we can get our Music Recommender System can be. Wish us luck!
