            <h1>Model</h1>
            <h2>Goal</h2>
            The purpose of this model is to recommend songs to add to a given playlist. Ideally the algorithm will recommend
            songs that would "fit well" in the playlist based on the playlist attributes. For example, if the input is a
            playlist of pop songs, a good model will recommend a similar pop song.

            <!--Data Selection-->

            <h2>Data Selection</h2>
            Our Million Playlist Dataset offered 1 million playlists. This would be computationally slow and difficult to work with.
            In addition to the size, we also learned from our exploratory data analysis that a majority of those playlists had
            only 1 follower. Playlists with more followers are more reliable and credible to use because it shows that the
            collection of songs are cohesive to a common theme that encourages users to follow to playlist. To deal with the larger
            dataset and also create a dataset with reliable playlists, we trimmed the dataset to have playlists with 8 or
            more followers.
            <br><br>
            From trimming our dataset, we calculated to following statistics:
            <li>Number of playlists: 11173</li>
            <li>Average number of tracks per playlist: 100.4752</li>
            <li>Average durations (ms) of playlists: 23785654.491</li>
            <li>Total number of tracks: 263985</li>
            <br>
            This is enough data to train and test our model.

            <h2>Recommending Algorithm</h2>
            <h3>Train/Test</h3>
            We split our trimmed dataset into a train and test set, with our training set being 80% of our dataset.

            <h3>Input</h3>
            Our alogrithm takes in a playlist with 30% of the songs "missing". The algorithm now needs to predict the 30%
            of the missing songs.

            <h3>Layer 1</h3>
            The first layer of our algorithm takes the input playlist and finds the playlist in the training set with the
            the most number of songs in common. Since we care about the credibility of the playlist and we measure that by
            how popular the playlist is, we then weigh the playlists by the number of follows it has. Playlists with the most
            song overlap and the highest number of followers have the highest similarity score.
            <br><br>
            Our algorithm recommends over 300 songs. We fill up a list of at least 300 recommended songs by taking songs from the most similar
            playlist that do not exist in the input playlist. We continue to iterate over the playlists (most similar playlists first)
            until we reach over 300 recommended songs.

            <h3>Layer 2</h3>
            Our second layer of our algorithm adds a level of song similarity to the model. Using the Spotify API, we find the
            10 attribute values (explained in Data Description) of the input playlist and find the average value for each attribute
            for the input playlist. We then find the 10 attribute values for each song in the list of recommended songs from
            Layer 1 and find the 10 attribute values for each.
            <br><br>
            After we have a list of the average attributes for the input playlist and also have collected all the attributes
            for each of the recommended songs, we then take the euclidean distance from each recommended song's attributes
            to the average attribute's of the input playlist. We take the 300 smallest distances and recommend those 300 songs.

            <h3>Output</h3>
            Using only the first layer, the output is a list of 300 or more songs. Using both the first and second layer,
            the output is a list of exactly 300 songs.
