                <h1>Description of Data</h1>
                <!--Description of Data-->
                At the beginning of our project, we only looking at the Million Playlist Dataset and the Million Song Dataset.
                After our Exploratory Data Analysis, we narrowed down our resources two resources: The Million Playlist
                Dataset and the Spotify API.
                <br><br>
                Here is a description of all three datasets/tools.

                <!--Million Playlist-->
                <h3>Million Playlist Dataset</h3>
                The <a href="https://recsys-challenge.spotify.com/">Million Playlist Dataset</a> contains 1,000,000 playlists created by users on the Spotify platform.
                These playlists were created during the period of January 2010 through October 2017. Each playlist in
                the MPD contains a playlist title, the track list (including track metadata) editing information (last
                edit time, number of playlist edits) and other miscellaneous information about the playlist.

                <h4>Detailed Description</h4>
                The Million Playlist Dataset consists of 1,000 slice files. These files have the naming convention of:
                <ul>mpd.slice._STARTING_PLAYLIST_ID_-_ENDING_PLAYLIST_ID_.json</ul>
                For example, the first 1,000 playlists in the MPD are in a file called  mpd.slice.0-999.json and the last
                1,000 playlists are in a file called mpd.slice.999000-999999.json. Each slice file is a JSON dictionary with
                two fields: info and playlists.
            </div>
            <div class="col-sm-3">
                <img src="img/spotify.png" style="width:231px; height:290px; padding:20px">
            </div>

            <div class="col-sm-12 text-left">
                <h4>info Field</h4>
                The info field is a dictionary that contains general information about the particular slice:
                <li>slice - the range of slices that in in this particular file - such as 0-999</li>
                <li>version - - the current version of the MPD (which should be v1)</li>
                <li>generated_on - a timestamp indicating when the slice was generated.</li>

                <h4>playlists Field</h4>
                This is an array that typically contains 1,000 playlists. Each playlist is a dictionary that contains
                the following fields:
                <li>pid - integer - playlist id - the MPD ID of this playlist. This is an integer between 0 and
                    999,999.</li>
                <li>name - string - the name of the playlist</li>
                <li> description - optional string - if present, the description given to the playlist. Note that userprovided
                    playlist descrptions are a relatively new feature of Spotify, so most playlists do not
                    have descriptions. </li>
                <li>modified_at - seconds - timestamp (in seconds since the epoch) when this playlist was last
                    updated. Times are rounded to midnight GMT of the date when the playlist was last updated.</li>
                <li>num_artists - the total number of unique artists for the tracks in the playlist.</li>
                <li>num_albums - the number of unique albums for the tracks in the playlist</li>
                <li>num_tracks - the number of tracks in the playlist</li>
                <li>num_followers - the number of followers this playlist had at the time the MPD was created.
                    (Note that the follower count does not including the playlist creator)</li>
                <li>num_edits - the number of separate editing sessions. Tracks added in a two hour window
                    are considered to be added in a single editing session.</li>
                <li>duration_ms - the total duration of all the tracks in the playlist (in milliseconds)</li>
                <li>collaborative - boolean - if true, the playlist is a collaborative playlist. Multiple users may
                    contribute tracks to a collaborative playlist.</li>
                <li>tracks - an array of information about each track in the playlist. Each element in the array is
                    a dictionary with the following fields:</li>
                <li>track_name - the name of the track</li>
                <li>track_uri - the Spotify URI of the track</li>
                <li>album_name - the name of the track’s album</li>
                <li>album_uri - the Spotify URI of the album</li>
                <li>artist_name - the name of the track’s primary artist</li>
                <li>artist_uri - the Spotify URI of track’s primary artist</li>
                <li>duration_ms - the duration of the track in milliseconds</li>
                <li>pos - the position of the track in the playlist (zero-based)</li>

                <!--Million Song-->
                <h3>Million Song Dataset</h3>
                The <a href="https://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/lastfm">Million Songs Dataset</a> was generated in 2010/2011. It provides songs and similar songs along with
                categorical tags.
                <br><br>
                This is what a single json file looks like:
                <br><br>

                <br><br>
                Each json file is 1 song with the following characteristics:
                <li>artist</li>
                <li>similar - a list of similar songs</li>
                <li>tags - phrases that are associated with the song</li>
                <li>track_id - song identifier for the database</li>
                <li>title - title of the track</li>

                <!--Spotify-->
                <h3>Spotify API</h3>
                After our Exploratory Data Analysis, realized that our data was not detailed enough at the song level. We
                wanted a model that could recommend songs based on song attributes. As a result, we decided to link our
                Million Playlist Dataset (using the Spotify URI for the track) and draw song attributes from the
                <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/">Spotify API</a>. The
                song attributes are as follows:
                <br><br>
                <li>danceability - describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements
                    including tempo, rhythm, stability, beat strength, and overall regularity.</li>
                <li>energy - represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity.</li>
                <li>key - the overall key of the track, with integers mpa to pitches using standard Pitch Class notation.</li>
                <li>loudness - the overall loudness of a track in decibels.</li>
                <li>speechiness - detects the presence of spoken words in a track</li>
                <li>acousticness - a measure from 0 to 1 of weather the track is acoustic.</li>
                <li>instrumentalness - predicts whether a track contain no vocals.</li>
                <li>liveness - detects the presence of an audience in the recording.</li>
                <li>valence - the musical positiveness conveyed by a track</li>
                <li>tempo - the overall estimated temp of a track in beats per minute</li>
                <br>

                <h1>Exploratory Data Analysis</h1>
                <!--EDA Introduction-->
                In our EDA, we initially started with cleaning through the Million Playlist Dataset and the Million Song Dataset.
                <br><br>
                Below we show the snippets of the 3 dataframes we began working with:
                <li>Million Playlists Dataframe</li>
                <li>Songs from the Million Playlists Dataframe (each playlist has a list of songs)</li>
                <li>Million Song Dataframe</li>

                <!--Million Playlist-->
                <h3>Exploring Million Playlist Dataset</h3>
                The Million Playlist Dataset was used from a Spotify challenge. Here's a snippet of our playlist dataframe in our python notebook:
                <img src="img/snippet1.png" style="width: 800px; height:300px">
                <br>
                This is a snippet of the dataframe for our million playlist dataset (the first slice, 1000 playlists).
                We can see from here, useful variables may be number of followers, number of songs, and possibly the number
                of artists. We will explore this further.
                <br><br>
                Here we have all the songs in the 1000 playlist set with an added column that links the song to the
                corresponding playlist. Now we have two dataframe that are linked through the "pid" and we hope to use
                information from both tables to make better recommendations.
                <img src="img/snippet2.png" style="width: 800px; height:300px">

                <!--Million Song-->
                <h3>Exploring Million Song Dataset</h3>
                Here is a snippet of the dataframe we created from the dataset:
                <img src="img/snippet3.png" style="width: 800px; height:200px">

                <!--Million Playlist Visualizations-->
                <h3>Preliminary Visualizations</h3>
                Insights we have gained from the EDA and the following preliminary visualizations:
                <li>The average number of songs in a playlist is about 70 songs</li>
                <li>Most playlists only have 1 follower. We may want to consider to value playlists that have a larger following,
                    which makes the music selection more accreditted, and therefore will likely have better recommendations</li>
                <li>Here we can see that the average of the average song duration per playlist is 233314 ms. We can use
                    this to create an interval that describes a reasonable song duration and use it as a cut-off.</li>

                </div>
            </div>

            <!--Additional Data Analysis-->
            <hr>
            <div class="col-sm-12">
                <h1>Additional Data Analysis</h1>
                After our exploratory data analysis, we learned that we were going to have difficulty linking the Million
                Playlist Dataset with the Million Song dataset. For example, track labels from each dataset might not match up.
                In addition, we wanted more information on the song level (more than the Million Song dataset provided). As
                a result, we decided to move forward with using the Million Playlist Dataset and accessing the Spotify API.
                Since the Million Playlist Dataset included the track Spotify URI, we were able to access the song attributes
                quickly.
                <br><br>
                We explored the Audio Features from the Spotify API and found these distributions:
                <br><br>
                <img src="img/scores.png" style="width: 800px; height:350px">
                <br><br>
                We then scattered the variables against each other to see if we found any significant patterns:
                <br><br>
                <img src="img/matrix.png" style="width: 800px; height:800px">
                <br><br>
                Since we aren't regressing on the Audio Features, the collinearity between features doesn't matter. We indeed
                to use the features as a vector to find euclidean distance between other points.
